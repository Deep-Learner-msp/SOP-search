"Explainable Blockchain" is an application that allows users to scan for potential vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts and get explanations of blockchain concepts using natural language responses generated by the Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The app provides a user-friendly interface for uploading Solidity files and selecting from two different prompts to receive explanations of blockchain concepts. The "Scan Vulnerabilities" feature analyzes Solidity code for potential security issues, helping users identify and address vulnerabilities before deploying their smart contracts to the blockchain. The "Explain Blockchain" feature leverages the power of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to provide clear and concise explanations of complex blockchain concepts in everyday language, improving user understanding and facilitating education in the blockchain space. Overall, "Explainable Blockchain" is a powerful tool for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to enhance their knowledge of blockchain technology and improve the security of their smart contracts.



"SS Genius" is an application that allows users to ask questions and receive natural language responses generated by the Azure OpenAI Turbo model, using a wrapper that interfaces with the SS Genius API. The app provides a user-friendly interface for submitting queries and receiving responses in real time. The SS Genius wrapper manages the prompt templates and handles user restrictions and jailbreak detections, ensuring that the app remains secure and reliable. The app also collects user feedback and stores it in a database for behavior analysis and knowledge base creation, enabling the app to learn and adapt over time. Overall, "SS Genius" is a powerful tool for anyone seeking accurate and reliable natural language responses to their questions, with robust security and advanced analytics capabilities to enhance user experience and knowledge over time.


"WisdomWiz" is an AI ML learning assistant that provides a user-friendly and conversational interface for learning about AI and ML topics, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics. The app leverages the power of the Azure OpenAI Turbo model and the SS Genius wrapper to provide natural language responses to user queries, while also providing personalized guidance and support through the "Act as AI Coach" prompt template. The app is designed to be accessible and useful to employees across a wide range of industries and skill levels, from beginners to experts in the field of AI and ML. Users can track their progress and revisit past conversations through the app's conversational history feature, and can download their notes for offline reference. Overall, "WisdomWiz" is a powerful tool for anyone seeking to learn about cutting-edge AI and ML technologies in a simple and intuitive way, with advanced analytics capabilities to enhance user experience and knowledge over time.





"Documagnet" is an application that provides users with answers to questions related to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents, while preserving the context of the original document. The app works in two phases: In the first phase, Business Units (BU) and teams submit their SOP documents, which are then used to create vector embeddings using the Azure OpenAI Ada model. These embeddings are stored in a vector store for later use. In the second phase, when a user submits a question, the app converts the question into a standalone format using the Azure OpenAI Turbo model. The app then uses the standalone question to create an embedding using the Ada model, and searches the vector store for similar documents. The app presents the relevant documents and standalone question to the Azure OpenAI Turbo model to extract the answer, which is then displayed in the app's user interface. Overall, "Documagnet" is a powerful tool for anyone seeking to quickly and accurately retrieve information from SOP documents, with advanced AI models and vector embeddings ensuring that the app preserves the context of the original document.
